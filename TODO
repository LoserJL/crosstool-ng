This is a somewhat ordered TODO list:

Recurring tasks:

- update versions for every tools...

- update and/or upgrade all samples


Non-recurring tasks:

- update newlib (for enhanced bare metal)
  - confirm existing implementation on targets other than AVR32
  - try to make it generic, will help for uClibc++

- multilib

- Cygwin target (needs newlib)
  - so we can build toolchains that generate code for Windows/Cygwin

- Cygwin host
  - so we can build toolchains that run natively under Windows/Cygwin

- mingw32 target
  - so we can build toolchains that generate code for Windows/Win32

- mingw32 host
  - so we can build toolchains that run natively under Windows/Win32
    (without requiring Cygwin)

- uClibc++
  - see newlib, above

- uClinux
  - check whether we can use newlib under uClinux (?)

- Darwin / Clang
  - driverdriver needs to be added to the project

  - llvm-gcc needs to work again.

  - CT_STATIC_TOOLCHAIN=y fails to build cctools ATM with recent LLVMs
    as the libraries have changed name since this was last done, switch
    to using "${program-prefix}-llvm-config --libs" to get list of libs.

  - Windows can't link cctools either statically or shared ATM.

  - HOST_LINK_VERSION is used instead of `${program-prefix}-ld --version`

  - `${program-prefix}-ld -v` yields @(#)PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:cctools-809
    instead of e.g. @(#)PROGRAM:ld  PROJECT:ld64-127

  - Add llvm-config-build and llvm-config-host for when going Canadian.

  - Consider adding PPC support?
